      ## Sequential steps to be followed when using this skill

      When numbered Skill, follow those steps.

      ### Create the test_skill Execution Checklist (MANDATORY)

      - Before executing anything, create a checklist named test_skill Execution Checklist with all steps of these instructions.
      - The test_skill Execution Checklist must include all numbered steps explicitly.
      - After completing each step of these instructions, mark the item in the test_skill Execution Checklist as completed.
      - Do not skip any item.
      - If an item cannot be executed, explicitly explain why.
      - Never mark the task as completed while any item from the test_skill Execution Checklist remains open.

      ### 1. Inform the user

      - Always tell the user "SKILL: I am numbered Skill" to inform the user that you are running this skill.

      ### 2. First Action
      - Do the first action

      ### 3. Second Action
      - Do the second action

      ### 4. Third Action

      ### Final Verification (MANDATORY)

      Before declaring the task complete:

      - Re-list all numbered steps from the test_skill Execution Checklist.
      - Confirm each one was executed.
      - If any step was not executed, execute it now.
