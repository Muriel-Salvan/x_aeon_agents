# X-Aeon Agents skills

This repository defines a set of AI agents skills that are used for X-Aeon projects.

## Ways skills are written

* Follow guidelines from the following sources:
  * [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification)
  * [Claude code best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices)
* Help agents follow those skills and their steps by using the following guidelines:
  * About skill name and YAML frontmatter:
    * Always name skills using `<verb>[-<object>-[<context>]]`.
    * Use gerund in the skill name.
    * Use third person in the skill description.
    * Always add a `Use when ...` part of the skill description.
  * About skill content:
    * Use Markdown for the skill's content.
    * Use imperative verbs (ex: `Read the README file to know about the CLI usage`).
    * Separate ordered steps in the skill's content using Markdown's headers (ex: `## 5. Perform data analysis`), and give details of this step using bullet points.
    * Don't mix several commands in 1 step. Split steps if several commands are involved.
    * Use `{variable_name}` to identify placeholders.
    * Be clear and consistent about commands: always use backticks to identify a command, and use a prefix for the command type. Here are the prefixes in use:
      * `cli: `: Used for command-line tools. Ex: ``Use `cli: ls -la` to list all the files``.
      * `agent: `: Used for agent commands. Ex: ``Use `agent: ask_followup_question` to ask the USER about the intent``.
      * `skill: `: Used for skills. Ex: ``Use `skill: creating-pull-request` to create the PR for {branch}``.
    * Don't use capital wordings as it adds emotional noise and is different from non-capitalized tokens used during LLMs training.
    * Use some wording in a consistent way. Those words are inspired by https://github.com/rohitg00/skillkit/blob/39b94534ec1c3698c0dec3a005744dafa99e63e9/packages/core/src/quality/index.ts
      * `User` represents the developer asking the agent to perform a task.
      * `Always` is used to emphasize that a specific step is mandatory (ex.: ``Always use `cli: gh` to gather issue information``).
      * `Never` is used to emphasize that a specific step should never be done (ex.: ``Never use `cli: gh` to create a PR``).
      * `If` ... `then` ... `else` are used to clearly identify some branching decisions.
      * `Plan` and `Act` modes refer to precisely the 2 ways of executing skills by the agents.
  * About skill semantics:
    * A skill is better followed when it consists only in a sequence of easily identified steps (like a workflow). Don't use vague guidelines in a skill.
    * When another skill is performing a sub-task of your skill, reference it explicitely, like ``Use `skill: skill_name` to perform this action`` instead of `Perform this action`. Don't rely on the model understanding that `skill_name` was the right skill to perform the action.
    * Always ask the agent to inform the user about executing the skill.
    * Any step that can be coded and automated with a tool should be implemented in a tool. Never rely on the guarantee that models will follow steps, unless they are implemented in a tool.

## General principles

Those principles allow for a safe agent interaction, while keeping its agility.

* The user sets the branch for the agent, in a worktree.
* Agents should never switch branches.
* Agents automatically push their changes to the github remote, and create a Pull Request for their branch.
* Agents can rebase their branch.

## Generating skills from ERB templates

Some skills are written as ERB templates (files ending with `.erb`) to allow dynamic content generation. To generate the final skill files from these templates, run the following executable:

```bash
bundle exec ruby bin/generate_skills
```

This will:
- Find all `.erb` files in the `skills/` directory
- Process them using the ERB engine (with `XAeonAgents::GenHelpers` available)
- Generate the corresponding output files (removing the `.erb` extension)

The following helper methods are available in ERB templates:
- `XAeonAgents::GenHelpers.init_skill_checklist` - Returns the "Create Execution Checklist (MANDATORY)" section
- `XAeonAgents::GenHelpers.validate_skill_checklist` - Returns the "Final Verification (MANDATORY)" section
