            Interpret files modifications and explain the changes properly with its meaning and intent.

            The goals are:
            - Get a general explanation of those changes.
            - Identify the kind of changes involved (new features, feature change, bug fix, documentation...).
            - Identify the components that are impacted by those changes (a specific plugin, CLI, UI...).

              Analyze the project files

              - Those files give you context to understand the changes.
              - Changes made on those files should NOT be explained unless they are part of the artifact named `#{artifact_ref(:files_diff)}`.
            EO_INSTRUCTIONS
            <<~EO_INSTRUCTIONS
              Create an artifact named `#{artifact_ref(:change_intent)}` to explain properly the changes reported by the artifact named `#{artifact_ref(:files_diff)}`

              - You MUST create an artifact named `change_intent` that contains:
                1. A general explanation of the changes, their meaning and intent in the context of this project.
                2. The types of changes (feature, bug fix, documentation, etc.).
                3. The impacted architectural components (backend, login screen, CLI, etc.).
              - Describe those changes in a way similar to a git commit comment or a pull request description.
              - ONLY cover changes from the artifact named `#{artifact_ref(:files_diff)}`.
              - Do NOT explain changes for other files.
